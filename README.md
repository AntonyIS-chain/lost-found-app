# Lost & Found Application

## Overview
The **Lost & Found Application** is a platform that connects individuals who have lost important documents (IDs, passports, certificates, etc.) with those who have found them. The system uses AI-powered matching to identify potential document matches and facilitate secure communication and recovery.

## Features
- **Report Lost Documents**: Users can report missing documents with descriptions and images.
- **Report Found Documents**: People who find documents can submit reports.
- **AI-Powered Matching**: Automated matching of lost and found documents using text and image recognition.
- **Secure User Communication**: Connects users securely without exposing personal contact details.
- **Payment-Based Retrieval**: Users pay a small fee to claim their document once a match is confirmed.
- **Rewards for Finders**: Option to reward individuals who return documents.
- **Admin Dashboard**: Manage reports, disputes, and verify document claims.

## Tech Stack
### Backend:
- **Golang** (Gin Framework) – Core API
- **Python** (FastAPI) – Matching & AI Services
- **PostgreSQL** – Main database
- **Redis** – Caching layer
- **Kafka / AWS SQS** – Event-driven messaging
- **GraphQL & REST API** – API communication

### Frontend:
- **Next.js** (TypeScript) – Mobile-first web application
- **Tailwind CSS** – UI Styling
- **React Query / Apollo** – Data fetching

### Infrastructure:
- **AWS** – Hosting, S3 (document storage), SES (email notifications)
- **Kubernetes (K8s)** – Deployment and scaling
- **NGINX** – API Gateway and reverse proxy
- **Docker** – Containerization

## System Architecture
The system is built using a **microservices architecture** for scalability and flexibility. Services include:
1. **User Service**: Manages authentication, profiles, and security.
2. **Lost & Found Service**: Handles document reporting, storage, and tracking.
3. **Matching Service**: Uses AI to find document matches.
4. **Notification Service**: Sends SMS, email, and push notifications.
5. **Payment Service**: Handles transaction processing and rewards.

## How It Works
1. **User Reports Document**: Enter details about a lost or found document.
2. **AI Matching**: The system scans found documents for potential matches.
3. **Match Found**: If a match exists, the lost document owner is notified.
4. **Payment & Verification**: The owner pays a small fee, and the system verifies ownership.
5. **Recovery & Reward**: The document finder and owner arrange pickup, and the finder can be rewarded.

## Monetization Strategy
- **Pay-to-Claim**: Users pay to retrieve matched documents.
- **Finder Rewards**: Optional reward system to encourage reporting.
- **Premium Verification**: Paid verification for high-value documents.
- **Ad Revenue**: Local businesses can advertise lost and found services.

## Deployment
### Running Locally
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-org/lostfound-app.git
cd lostfound-app

# Start services with Docker
docker-compose up --build
```
